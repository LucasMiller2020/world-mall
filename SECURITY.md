## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, please report it responsibly. Do **not** create a public issue. Instead, send an email to **Personal.LucasMiller@gmail.com** with a description of the issue and steps to reproduce it. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours and aim to provide a status update within seven days.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much information as possible, including:

- A description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof of concept
- Any recommendations for remediation

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security issues.

## Scope

This project is a hackathon demo. While we strive for security best practices, the code is not production‑hardened. Please do not use this software in production environments.

There is currently no bug bounty program for this project. Reports submitted in good faith will receive our appreciation and credit in release notes (with your permission).
