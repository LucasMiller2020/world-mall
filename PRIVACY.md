# Privacy Notice

World Mall respects your privacy. This mini‑app is designed to operate with minimal personal data and a strong focus on anonymity.

## Data we collect

- **World ID nullifier hashes** – when you verify with World ID, we hash your nullifier (using SHA‑256) to record that you have verified. This hashed value is not personally identifiable.
- **Operational metadata** – we log basic request metadata (such as timestamps, route accessed and anonymous user ID) to monitor the app and enforce rate limits. These logs do not contain personal information.
- **Guest messages** – messages posted in the Global Square are stored for up to seven days. They are associated with your anonymous session ID or hashed nullifier, not your World ID or any real‑world identity.

## How we use data

We use the data we collect solely to operate World Mall: enforcing message limits, enabling verification, moderating content and improving the service. We do not sell or rent any data to third parties.

## Cookies and sessions

World Mall uses a cookie (`wm_uid`) to store your anonymous session identifier after verification. If your browser blocks third‑party cookies, we fall back to an `X‑Session` header. These identifiers are random and cannot be tied back to your real identity.

## Your rights

You can request a copy of your data or request deletion by emailing **Personal.LucasMiller@gmail.com**. Because we store only anonymous identifiers, we may ask you to provide the session identifier or hashed nullifier associated with your account to locate your data.

## Changes to this notice

This Privacy Notice may be updated as the project evolves. Material changes will be communicated via the repository’s release notes.
