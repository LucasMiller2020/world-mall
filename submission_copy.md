## Project Title
World Mall — Global Square for Verified Humans

## One-liner (140 chars)
A World App Mini App where verified humans talk, learn, build, and connect—guest-friendly, with seamless World ID verification.

## Short description (150–200 words)
World Mall brings the internet’s town square into the World App. Guests can say hi instantly (60 chars, 10/day), while a one-tap World ID verification unlocks full conversation: 240-char posts, starring, reporting, and Work Mode for hiring, advice, and collaboration. Under the hood, the app uses a privacy-first identity model (hashed nullifiers) and server-side rate limiting to keep conversations human. Real-time updates use WebSockets with SSE/poll fallback to behave well inside mobile webviews. The UI follows the World Design Guidelines and includes a theme toggle (light/dark, system, and sunrise→sunset auto mode). Next: we’ll integrate World Chat when available to power DMs/friends without rebuilding messaging. We’ll also add "Mall Coins" reactions and custom emoji packs to reward great posts and fund community bounties. World Mall is designed to scale: a human-first entry path (guest), a strong verification moment, and lightweight moderation that grows with the network.
